# Main Process Architecture

## Overview
The main process is the core of the Browser OS application, built using Electron. It handles system-level operations and manages the application lifecycle.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Application Lifecycle Management
- Application initialization and startup
- Window creation and management
- Application state persistence
- System tray integration
- Auto-update handling

### 2. Window Management
- Primary window creation and configuration
- Window state management (size, position, maximized state)
- Window focus handling
- Multi-window coordination

### 3. IPC Communication
- Handling IPC messages from renderer processes
- Managing secure communication channels
- Event broadcasting to renderer processes
- State synchronization

### 4. System Integration
- Native system APIs interaction
- File system operations
- System notifications
- Power management
- Network status monitoring

## Key Components

### Main Process Modules
```typescript
// Main process core modules
- main.electron.ts        // Main entry point
- windowManager.ts       // Window management
- ipcManager.ts         // IPC communication
- systemManager.ts      // System integration
- stateManager.ts       // State management
```

### State Management
- Application settings
- Window states
- System preferences
- User preferences

### Security Features
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- Secure IPC channels
- Permission management
- Sandbox configuration

## Process Flow

### Startup Sequence
1. Application initialization
2. Configuration loading
3. Window creation
4. IPC setup
5. System integration initialization

### Shutdown Sequence
1. Window cleanup
2. State persistence
3. IPC cleanup
4. System integration cleanup
5. Application termination

## Best Practices
- Keep main process lightweight
- Implement proper error handling
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Follow security best practices
- Implement proper logging and debugging

## Integration Points
- Renderer Process
- System APIs
- File System
- Network
- Native Modules

## Performance Considerations
- Memory management
- CPU usage optimization
- IPC message optimization
- Resource cleanup
- Background task management
