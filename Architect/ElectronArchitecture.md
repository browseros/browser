# Electron Architecture

## Overview
The Browser OS Electron implementation handles the desktop application lifecycle, window management, and native system integration.

## Main Process Architecture

### Window Management
```typescript
// Main window configuration
const windowConfig = {
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  frame: false  // Frameless window for custom titlebar
};

// Window lifecycle management
- Window creation and initialization
- Window state persistence
- Multi-window support preparation
```

### Application Lifecycle
- **Initialization**: Application bootstrap and window creation
- **State Management**: Window state handling and persistence
- **Platform-specific Behavior**: 
  - macOS: Dock integration and menu bar handling
  - Windows/Linux: Standard window management

### IPC Communication
- **Native Dialogs**: System dialog integration
- **System Integration**: File system and OS-level features
- **Security**: Secure IPC channel management

## Development Features

### DevTools Integration
- Redux DevTools for state inspection
- Devtron for Electron debugging
- Future support for Angular Augury

### Window Management Features
- Frameless window support
- Custom titlebar implementation
- Window state persistence
- Multi-monitor support

## Security Considerations

### IPC Security
- Validated message passing
- Secure channel establishment
- Permission handling

### File System Security
- Sandboxed file access
- Secure file handling
- Path validation

## Performance Optimizations

### Window Performance
- Optimized window creation
- Efficient state management
- Resource cleanup

### Process Communication
- Optimized IPC patterns
- Batched updates
- Event debouncing

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
